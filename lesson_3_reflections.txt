When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To work with someone or to share your project for public.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

To divide it logically like commits in branches.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks use when you need your own copy of existed repo on GitHub, clones - local copy and branches for distributing features and patches in one repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

To track all new changes.
